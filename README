This is just Lewis playing with Play
====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.
 
I'm using "Play for Scala" book exercises as a starting point.  Currently 
running on Play 2.4.2, but it has some warts in themes and some if-fy 
handling of internationalization since the book was handling I18n an old way.

To see it running just clone the repo; `activator run`; http://localhost:9000
